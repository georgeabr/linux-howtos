# Configuration file generated by pwmconfig, changes will be lost
# This configuration is specifically tailored for fans that operate in discrete steps.
# It ensures the fan is "always on" at its lowest reliable speed (80 PWM)
# to eliminate the jarring "off-to-on" spike.

# MINTEMP is the temperature below which the fan will stay at MINSTOP.

# MINSTART: The lowest PWM value that causes the fan to spin. This is 80.
MINSTART=hwmon7/pwm2=80 hwmon7/pwm1=80

# CRITICAL SETTING: Set MINSTOP to 80.
# This ensures the fan never turns completely off (0 PWM).
# It will always spin at a minimum of 80 PWM (~2500 RPM),
# achieving the "always on at any temp" behaviour you requested.

# Format: PWM=TEMP PWM=TEMP ...
# - 80 PWM at 20C (and below) - Fan at ~2500 RPM (MINSTOP)
# - 80 PWM at 50C - Fan at ~2500 RPM (ensures this step is held)
# - 180 PWM at 60C - Fan at ~2700 RPM (second step)
# - 225 PWM at 70C - Fan at ~5070 RPM (third step)
# - 255 PWM at 80C (or above) - Fan at ~5090 RPM (max step)
